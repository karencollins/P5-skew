# P5-skew
P5 js skew an imported image 

Simple sketch uses two sliders to skew an imported graphic along horizontal and vertical axis. 

You need to import P5 JS  into your folder and edit index.html to point to that file. 
Choose either sketch (adjust width and height on sliders) or 
sketch2, which is a progressively increasing stretch vertically as you adjust horizontal.
